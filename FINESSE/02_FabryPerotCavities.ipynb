    "From the plot above we can see that on resonance, the cavity transmits all of the input light from the laser, with the amount transmitted decreasing as we move away from resonance. This shows one of the uses for cavities: a **spectral filter**. If light at the resonance frequency of the cavity, $\\omega_0$, is incident upon it, it will all pass through. Light at different frequencies will be partially reflected, wih more and more being reflected as we move away from resonance. This leaves us with a beam mostly made up of frequencies near the resonance frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectral filtering property of a cavity can also be used for another purpose. By measuring the amount of light transmitted, we can clearly see any deviation of the cavity length or the laser frequency from resonance, as the measured power will decrease. In this way, a cavity can be used to **stabilise** a light source, by allowing us to measure the frequency very precisely.\n",

The only difference is the factor $R_2$ instead of $T_2$ in the numerator, which will vary depending on where in the cavity you measure the field. This change leads to the most useful feature of cavities for GW detectors. Let's plot the power again, this time looking at the circulating power:"

    "Hopefully by now you've seen that the mathematics behind deriving properties of just a simple two mirror setup can be very complicated, even with all the approximations we've made. For a full interferometer layout, there can be up to a hundred or so components involved, with multiple light frequencies and non-plane-wave beams; doing the calculations on paper is infeasible! Instead, we can use computers to do the work for us, by simulating the interferometer numerically. This is the purpose of Finesse, which you will be introduced to in the next session."
